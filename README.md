## Description

This project is a part of the challenge from "Advanced Web Development" Bootcamp, where we focus on building a NestJS application that serves as a book library API corresponding to the OpenAPI specification. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on books, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting book records.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

# How to create same project from scratch

## 1. **Initialize the project**

Use the terminal to navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize a new NestJS project:

```bash
npx @nestjs/cli new nestjs-ci
cd nestjs-ci
npm install
```

## 2. **Set up Git**

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and other unnecessary files from being tracked by Git. You can use the following command:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Then add the following lines to your `.gitignore` file:

```
# .gitignore
node_modules
dist
```

Then, run the following commands to initialize Git and make your first commit:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## 3. **Create a GitHub repository** using gh CLI

Install the GitHub CLI if you haven't already. You can find installation instructions [here](https://cli.github.com/).


Authorize the GitHub CLI with your GitHub account by running:
```bash
gh auth login
```

Then, create a new repository on GitHub using the following command:
```bash
gh repo create nestjs-ci --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

## 4. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow**

Create a new directory called `.github/workflows` in your project root and create a file named `ci.yml` inside it:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
``` 

Then, add the following content to the `ci.yml` file:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
This workflow will run on every push or pull request to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, installs Node.js, installs dependencies using `npm ci`, and runs tests.

For npm ci command It's important to ensure that your have `package-lock.json` committed to your repository, as `npm ci` relies on it to install the exact versions of dependencies specified in the lock file.

## 5. **Commit and push changes**

Add the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to your Git repository, commit the changes, and push them to GitHub:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow you just created.

## 6. **Verify the CI workflow**

Go to your GitHub repository and navigate to the "Actions" tab. You should see the workflow running. If everything is set up correctly, it will pass the tests and show a green checkmark.

## 7. **Generate the NestJS resource for books**

To generate the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the books, you can use the NestJS CLI to generate a new resource:

```bash
npx @nestjs/cli generate resource books
```

This command will create a new `books` module, controller, and service in your project.

## 8. **Add OpenAPI support (optional)**

To add OpenAPI support to your NestJS application, you can use the `@nestjs/swagger` package. Install it by running:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/swagger
```

Then, update your `main.ts` file to set up Swagger:

```typescript
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { SwaggerModule, DocumentBuilder } from '@nestjs/swagger';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  const config = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('Book Library API')
    .setDescription('A simple API to manage a collection of books')
    .setVersion('1.0.0')
    .build();
  const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, config);
  SwaggerModule.setup('api', app, document);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```
This will set up Swagger documentation for your API at the `/api/docs` endpoint.

To view the Swagger UI, start your NestJS application `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api` in your web browser.

## 9. Implement DTOs for the `books` resource corresponding to the OpenAPI specification

To implement the OpenAPI specification for the `books` resource, you need to have 3 DTOs: `create-book.dto.ts`, `update-book.dto.ts` and `response-book.dto.ts`.

In this step, we will create the DTOs and use decorators for validation, transformation and documentation.
- **Validation**: Ensures that the data sent to the API meets certain criteria (e.g., required fields, data types).
- **Transformation**: Converts the data into a specific format or structure before it is processed by the application.
- **Documentation**: Provides metadata about the API endpoints, making it easier for developers to understand how to use the API.

### Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @nestjs/class-validator @nestjs/class-transformer @nestjs/swagger
```

In the create book DTO, you will define the properties required to create a new book.

### Create book DTO

Update a file named `create-book.dto.ts` in the `src/books/dto` directory:

```typescript
import { IsNotEmpty, IsInt, IsString } from "@nestjs/class-validator"
import { ApiProperty } from "@nestjs/swagger"

export class CreateBookDto {
    @IsNotEmpty()
    @IsString()
    @ApiProperty({ example: "The Great Gatsby" })
    title: string

    @IsNotEmpty()
    @IsString()
    @ApiProperty({ example: "F. Scott Fitzgerald" })
    author: string

    @IsNotEmpty()
    @IsInt()
    @ApiProperty({ example: "1925" })
    publishedYear: number
}
```
Used decorators:
- `@IsNotEmpty()`: Ensures that the field is not empty.
- `@IsString()`: Validates that the field is a string.
- `@IsInt()`: Validates that the field is an integer.
- `@ApiProperty()`: Provides metadata for Swagger documentation, including an example value.

### Update book DTO

The update book DTO will have the same properties but will allow partial updates.

### Response book DTO

The response book DTO will define the structure of the book object returned by the API.
Create a file named `response-book.dto.ts` in the `src/books/dto` directory:

```typescript
import { Expose } from "@nestjs/class-transformer"
import { IsInt, IsString, IsUUID } from "@nestjs/class-validator"

export class ResponseBookDto {
    @Expose()
    @IsUUID()
    id: string

    @Expose()
    @IsString()
    title: string

    @Expose()
    @IsString()
    author: string

    @Expose()
    @IsInt()
    publishedYear: number
}
```
Explanation of decorators used:
- `@Expose()`: Indicates that the property should be included in the serialized output.
- `@IsUUID()`: Validates that the field is a valid UUID.
- `@IsString()`: Validates that the field is a string.
- `@IsInt()`: Validates that the field is an integer.
- `@ApiProperty()`: Provides metadata for Swagger documentation, including an example value.

## 10. Enable Validation and Transformation to work

There are two main parts to enable validation and transformation in your NestJS application: incoming requests and outgoing responses.

### Incoming Requests

To enable validation and transformation in your NestJS application for incoming requests, you need to set up global pipes in your `main.ts` file:

```typescript
import { ValidationPipe } from '@nestjs/common';
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({
      transform: true, // Enable transformation of payloads
      whitelist: true, // Strip properties that are not in the DTO
      forbidNonWhitelisted: true, // Throw an error if non-whitelisted properties are present
  }));
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```
Explanation of the options used in `ValidationPipe`:
- `transform: true`: Automatically transforms the payload into the DTO class instance.
- `whitelist: true`: Strips properties that are not defined in the DTO.
- `forbidNonWhitelisted: true`: Throws an error if non-whitelisted properties are present.

### Outgoing Responses

For the outgoing response the NestJS don't apply the validation and transformation by automatically, so you need to use to use plainToClass function from `@nestjs/class-transformer` in the  controller where you return the response.

```typescript
import { plainToClass } from '@nestjs/class-transformer';
import { ResponseBookDto } from './dto/response-book.dto';

@Get(':id')
async findOne(@Param('id') id: string): Promise<ResponseBookDto> {
  const book = await this.booksService.findOne(id);
  return plainToClass(ResponseBookDto, book); // Transform the book object to ResponseBookDto.
}
```
Explanation of the `plainToClass` function:
- `plainToClass(ResponseBookDto, book)`: Converts the plain JavaScript object `book` into an instance of the `ResponseBookDto` class, applying any transformation and validation defined in the DTO.

### 11. **Implement the BooksController**

Update the `books.controller.ts` file in the `src/books` directory to implement the CRUD operations for the books resource. Here is an example of how you can implement the controller.

```typescript
import { ApiAcceptedResponse, ApiNotFoundResponse, ApiOperation } from '@nestjs/swagger';
import { ResponseBookDto } from './dto/response-book.dto';
import { UUID } from 'node:crypto';
import { ParseUUIDPipe } from '@nestjs/common';
import { plainToClass } from '@nestjs/class-transformer';

@Controller('books')
export class BooksController {
  constructor(private readonly booksService: BooksService) { }

  @Get(':id')
  @ApiOperation({ summary: "Get a book by ID" })
  @ApiAcceptedResponse({ description: "A single book" })
  @ApiNotFoundResponse({ description: "Book not found" })
  async findOne(@Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe) id: UUID): Promise<ResponseBookDto> {
    const book = await this.booksService.findOne(id)
    if (!book) throw new NotFoundException('Book not found')
    return plainToClass(ResponseBookDto, book)
  }
```

### Documentation of the BooksController

Use the decorators from `@nestjs/swagger` like `@ApiOperation`, `@ApiAcceptedResponse`, and `@ApiNotFoundResponse` to document the API endpoints.

### Incoming request validation

Use the ParseUUIDPipe from `@nestjs/common` to validate the incoming request parameters, such as the book ID. This ensures that the ID is a valid UUID before processing the request.

### Outgoing response transformation with plainToClass

Use the `plainToClass` function from `@nestjs/class-transformer` to transform the response object to the DTO. This ensures that the response adheres to the structure defined in the DTO and applies any necessary transformations.

### Asynchronous operations

Use async/await for asynchronous operations to handle the database calls in a non-blocking manner.
Note that the return type of asynchronous function is `Promise<SomeType>`, regardless of the actual type returned by the function.

### Typing the response

Use the `ResponseBookDto` as the return type for the `findOne`, `update`, and `remove` methods to ensure that the response adheres to the structure defined in the DTO.

### Exception handling

Use the `NotFoundException` from `@nestjs/common` to handle cases where a book is not found. This will return a 404 status code and a descriptive error message.
