# How to create same project from scratch

## 1. **Initialize the project**

Use the terminal to navigate to your project directory and run the following command to initialize a new NestJS project:

```bash
npx @nestjs/cli new nestjs-ci
cd nestjs-ci
npm install
```

## 2. **Set up Git**

Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and other unnecessary files from being tracked by Git. You can use the following command:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Then add the following lines to your `.gitignore` file:

```
# .gitignore
node_modules
dist
```

Then, run the following commands to initialize Git and make your first commit:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

## 3. **Create a GitHub repository** using gh CLI

Install the GitHub CLI if you haven't already. You can find installation instructions [here](https://cli.github.com/).


Authorize the GitHub CLI with your GitHub account by running:
```bash
gh auth login
```

Then, create a new repository on GitHub using the following command:
```bash
gh repo create nestjs-ci --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

## 4. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow**

Create a new directory called `.github/workflows` in your project root and create a file named `ci.yml` inside it:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
``` 

Then, add the following content to the `ci.yml` file:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
This workflow will run on every push or pull request to the `main` branch. It checks out the code, installs Node.js, installs dependencies using `npm ci`, and runs tests.

For npm ci command It's important to ensure that your have `package-lock.json` committed to your repository, as `npm ci` relies on it to install the exact versions of dependencies specified in the lock file.

## 5. **Commit and push changes**

Add the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to your Git repository, commit the changes, and push them to GitHub:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow you just created.

## 6. **Verify the CI workflow**

Go to your GitHub repository and navigate to the "Actions" tab. You should see the workflow running. If everything is set up correctly, it will pass the tests and show a green checkmark.
